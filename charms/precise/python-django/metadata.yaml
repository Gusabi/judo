  Django is a high-level web application framework that loosely follows
  the model-view-controller design pattern.  Python's equivalent to Ruby
  on Rails, Django lets you build complex data-driven websites quickly
  and easily - Django focuses on automating as much as possible and
  adhering to the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle.  Django
  additionally emphasizes reusability and "pluggability" of components;
  many generic third-party "applications" are available to enhance
  projects or to simply to reduce development time even further.
  Notable features include: * An object-relational mapper (ORM) *
  Automatic admin interface * Elegant URL dispatcher * Form
  serialization and validation system * Templating system * Lightweight,
  standalone web server for development and testing *
  Internationalization support * Testing framework and client
