description: |
  Git is popular version control system designed to handle very large
  projects with speed and efficiency; it is used for many high profile
  open source projects, most notably the Linux kernel.  Git falls in the
  category of distributed source code management tools. Every Git
  working directory is a full-fledged repository with full revision
  tracking capabilities, not dependent on network access or a central
  server.  This package provides the git main components with minimal
  dependencies. Additional functionality, e.g. a graphical user
  interface and revision tree visualizer, tools for interoperating with
  other VCS's, or a web interface, is provided as separate git*
  packages.
